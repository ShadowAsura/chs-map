# Campus Map for Cupertino High School üó∫Ô∏è

## Structure
- vercel for deployment!


## Issues
- Is there a bathroom/something between 6105 & 6101 and also with 6205 & 6201
- Is Rm 703 the Color Guard room or Percussion room or what?

## Dev Notes (Jun 14, 2023)
- this is either gonna suck or be kinda cool
- i hope i can finish this in a couple days
- svgs are kinda cool but also kinda terrible to work with
- typescript is kinda cool when you're making the types yourself for data
